# Summary

- I am a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Utah, working under [Prof. Pavel Panchekha](pavpanchekha.com).
- My broad interests lie in the field of Formal Verification. Specifically, I am interested in using formal specifications to make tools to empower programmers to build correct and reliable software.
- Currently I am working on automatically finding and explaining the root causes of error in floating point expressions.

# Experiences

## Graduate Research Assistant, under Prof. Pavel Panchekha

**January 2024 - present**

 - Researching ways to automatically explain sources of errors in floating point operations.
 - Currently working on extending the [Herbie](https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie) tool to generate English explanations for floating point errors
 
## M.S. in Computer Science @ The University of Utah

**August 2023 - present**

 - CGPA: 4.0/4.0
 - Courses: Programming Languages, Computer Architecture, Graduate Algorithms, Functional Programming, Software Verification
 - Worked as a graduate teaching assistant for the course CS 3810: Computer Organinzation. Responsibilities involved conducting office hours and grading assignments
 
## Researcher @ HCFC Lab, BITS Pilani Goa

**August 2022 - December 2022**

 - Developing a portable Indian Sign Language translator.
 - Research involved conversing with actual Indian Sign Language users at a disabilities school to learn the semantics and usage of Indian Sign Language, and to gauge interest in a portable translator.
 - Investigated ways, included beam search and Hidden Markov Models, to predict how signed gestures transition between each other.
 
## Formalizing automatons with Prof. SP Suresh and Prof. Anup Basil Mathew @ Chennai Mathematical Institute, India

**June 2022 - August 2022**

 - A summer project to formalize some basic theorems on DFAs and NFAs in the Coq Proof Assistant.
Proved some basic operations on DFAs, like the construction of complement, union and intersection.
 - Proved construction of NFAs from DFAs and DFAs from NFAs, and as a consequence proved their
equivalence.

## Adapting proof assistants into CS courses with Prof. Anup Basil Mathew @ BITS Pilani, Goa

**January 2021 - December 2021**

 - Worked on the Coq Proof Assistant and its applications in formalizing mathematics and algorithms.
 - Some theoretical parts of our discussion about the constructive logic of Coq were adapted into future offerings of Prof. Anup Basil Matthew’s Discrete Structures in Computer Science course

## B.E. in Computer Science Engineering, BITS Pilani, Goa, India

**2019 - 2023**

 - CGPA: 8.89/10
 - Merit scholarship holder
 - Teaching Assistant for various courses: Operating Systems, Compiler Construction, Computer Networks, Computer Architecture, VLSI Design (Master’s level course), Discrete Structures, Computer Programming
 
# Projects

Trinity Game Engine

 : A game engine bundled with a VM-interpreted language. The Core language is
   compiled into a custom byte-code, which is then interpreted by a handwritten 
   virtual machine. The compiled byte-code is then connected to the game engine, 
   and instructions control what is drawn on the screen.

Logic in Coq

 : A formalization of classical propositional logic in Coq, along with a 
   formalization and proof of the soundness of Natural Deduction for 
   propositional logic in Coq. 
   [source](https://github.com/wags-1314/logic-in-Coq)
   
CheemScheme

: This is a dialect of Scheme implemented in C++. Currently supports arithmetic 
  operations, variables and state, conditional branching, and lambdas. The 
  interpreter also optimizes tail recursion and can identify and report syntax 
  and runtime errors.
